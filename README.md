The Sail ISA specification language
===================================

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Overview
========

Sail is a language for describing the instruction-set architecture
(ISA) semantics of processors. Sail aims to provide a
engineer-friendly, vendor-pseudocode-like language for describing
instruction semantics. It is essentially a first-order imperative
language, but with lightweight dependent typing for numeric types and
bitvector lengths, which are automatically checked using <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3</a>. It has
been used for several papers, available from
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/>.
<p>



Given a Sail definition, the tool will type-check it and generate
documentation, executable emulators (in C and OCaml), theorem-prover definitions (for
Isabelle, HOL4, and Coq), and definitions to integrate with our 
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/rmem">RMEM</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/rems-project/isla">isla-axiomatic</a>
tools for
concurrency semantics.
The <a href="https://github.com/rems-project/isla">Isla</a> engine provides SMT-based symbolic evaluation for Sail models,
and the <a href="https://github.com/rems-project/islaris">Islaris</a> verification tool integrates Isla output with the Iris program logic to support proof about binary code in Coq. 
Not all models are integrated with all tools - see the most recent papers and models for
descriptions of the current state.

This repository contains the implementation of Sail, together with
some Sail specifications and related tools.

* A manual, [doc/manual.html](doc/manual.html) with source (in [doc/](doc/)), currently [available online here](https://alasdair.github.io/manual.html)

* The Sail source code (in [src/](src/))

* Generated Isabelle snapshots of some ISA models, in [snapshots/isabelle](snapshots/isabelle)

* Documentation for generating Isabelle and working with the ISA specs
  in Isabelle in [lib/isabelle/manual.pdf](lib/isabelle/manual.pdf)

* Simple emacs and VSCode modes with syntax highlighting (in [editors/](editors/))

* A test suite for Sail (in [test/](test/))

The support library for Coq models is in [a separate repository](https://github.com/rems-project/coq-sail) to help our package management.

Sail ISA Models
===============

Sail is currently being used for Arm-A, Morello (CHERI-Arm), RISC-V, CHERI-RISC-V, MIPS, CHERI-MIPS, IBM Power, and x86 models,  variously ranging from full definitions (able to boot an OS in the Sail-generated emulator) to core user-mode fragments:

### REMS Models

* [Sail Armv9.3-A and Armv8.5-A ISA models, automatically generated from the Arm-internal ASL reference, as used in the Arm ARM](https://github.com/rems-project/sail-arm).

* [Sail Armv8.3-A ISA model](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/aarch64). This is the "public" model described in our [POPL 2019 paper](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/sail/sail-popl2019.pdf), now largely superseded by the above.

* [Sail Armv8-A ISA model, handwritten](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/aarch64_small). This is a handwritten user-mode fragment.

* [Sail Morello (CHERI-Arm) ISA model](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-morello), automatically generated from the Arm-internal ASL definition.  This was the basis for our [Morello security proofs](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-morello-proofs/blob/public/README.md).

* [Sail RISC-V ISA model, handwritten](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv). This has been adopted by the RISC-V Foundation.

* [Sail MIPS and CHERI-MIPS ISA models, handwritten](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-cheri-mips).

* [Sail IBM POWER ISA model, automatically generated from IBM XML documentation](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/old/power).  This is a user-mode fragment. 

* [Sail x86 ISA model, handwritten](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/tree/sail2/old/x86). This is a handwritten user-mode fragment. 

The hand-written IBM POWER, and x86 models are currently not in sync
with the latest version of Sail, which is the (default) sail2 branch
on Github.  These and the RISC-V model are integrated with our [RMEM](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/rmem) tool for concurrency semantics. 

### External Models

* [Sail 32-bit RISC-V model, partially handwritten and partially generated](https://github.com/thoughtpolice/rv32-sail). This currently implements a fragment of the machine mode (-M) specification for RV32IM. (Developed independently of the full RISC-V model for the REMS project.)

Installation
============

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for how
to install Sail using opam.

Emacs Mode
==========

[editors/sail-mode.el](editors/sail-mode.el) contains an Emacs mode
for the most recent version of Sail which provides some basic syntax
highlighting.

VSCode Mode
===========

[editors/vscode](editors/vscode) contains a Visual Studio Code mode
which provides some basic syntax highlighting. It is also available
on the VSCode Marketplace.

CLion/PyCharm Syntax highlighting
===========

[editors/vscode/sail](editors/vscode/sail) contains a Visual Studio Code
mode which provides some basic syntax highlighting. CLion/PyCharm can also
parse the [editors/vscode/sail/syntax/sail.tmLanguage.json](sail.tmLanguage.json)
file and use it to provide basic syntax highlighting.
To install open `Preferences > Editor > TextMate Bundles`. On that settings
page press the `+` icon and locate the [editors/vscode/sail](editors/vscode/sail)
directory.

This requires the [TextMate Bundles plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7221-textmate-bundles).

Vim
===

[editors/vim](editors/vim) contains support for syntax highlighting in the vim
editor, in vim's usual format of an `ftdetect` directory to detect Sail files
and a `syntax` directory to provide the actual syntax highlighting.

Logo
====

[etc/logo](etc/logo) contains the Sail logo
