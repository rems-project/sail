:riscv-code: sail_doc/riscv_duopod.json

We introduce the basic features of Sail via a small example from our
RISC-V model that includes just two instructions: add immediate and
load double. We start by defining the default order (see <<Vectors>>
for details), and including the Sail prelude:

sail::PREAMBLE[from=riscv-code,type=span,trim]

The Sail prelude is very minimal, and it is expected that Sail
specifications will usually build upon it. Some Sail specifications
are derived from pre-existing pseudocode, which already use specific
idioms -- our Sail Arm specification uses `ZeroExtend` and
`SignExtend` mirroring the ASL code, whereas our MIPS and RISC-V
specification use `EXTZ` and `EXTS` for the same functions. Therefore for
this example we define zero-extension and sign-extension functions as:

[source,sail]
----
include::sail:EXTZ[from=riscv-code,type=val]
include::sail:EXTZ[from=riscv-code,type=function]

include::sail:EXTS[from=riscv-code,type=val]
include::sail:EXTS[from=riscv-code,type=function]
----

We now define an integer type synonym `xlen`, which for this example
will be equal to 64. Sail supports definitions which are generic over
both regular types, and integers (think const generics in C++, but
more expressive). We also create a type `xlenbits` for bitvectors of
length `xlen`.

[source,sail]
----
include::sail:xlen[from=riscv-code,type=type]
include::sail:xlen_bytes[from=riscv-code,type=type]
include::sail:xlenbits[from=riscv-code,type=type]
----

For the purpose of this example, we also introduce a type synonym for
bitvectors of length 5, which represent registers.

sail::regbits[from=riscv-code,type=type]

We now set up some basic architectural state. First creating a
register of type `xlenbits` for both the program counter `PC`, and
the next program counter, `nextPC`. We define the general purpose
registers as a vector of 32 `xlenbits` bitvectors. The `dec`
keyword isn't important in this example, but Sail supports two
different numbering schemes for (bit)vectors `inc`, for most
significant bit is zero, and `dec` for least significant bit is
zero. We then define a getter and setter for the registers, which
ensure that the zero register is treated specially (in
RISC-V register 0 is always hardcoded to be 0). Finally we overload
both the read (`rX`) and write (`wX`) functions as simply
`X`. This allows us to write registers as `X(r) = value` and
read registers as `value = X(r)`. Sail supports flexible ad-hoc
overloading, and has an expressive l-value language in assignments,
with the aim of allowing pseudo-code like definitions.

include::sail:PC[from=riscv-code,type=register]
include::sail:nextPC[from=riscv-code,type=register]

include::sail:Xs[from=riscv-code,type=register]

include::sail:rX[from=riscv-code,type=val]
include::sail:rX[from=riscv-code,type=function]

include::sail:wX[from=riscv-code,type=val]
include::sail:wX[from=riscv-code,type=function]

include::sail:XOVERLOAD[from=riscv-code,type=span]
----

We also give a function `MEMr` for reading memory, this function just
points at a builtin we have defined elsewhere.  The builtin is very
general (it allows addresses of multiple bitwidths), so we also derive
a simpler `read_mem` function.

[source,sail]
----
include::sail:MEMr[from=riscv-code,type=val]

include::sail:read_mem[from=riscv-code,type=val]
include::sail:read_mem[from=riscv-code,type=function]

It's common when defining architecture specifications to break
instruction semantics down into separate functions that handle
decoding (possibly even in several stages) into custom intermediate
datatypes and executing the decoded instructions. However it's often
desirable to group the relevant parts of these functions and datatypes
together in one place, as they would usually be found in an
architecture reference manual. To support this Sail supports
_scattered_ definitions. First we give types for the execute and
decode functions, as well as the `ast` union.

[source,sail]
----
include::sail:iop[from=riscv-code,type=type]

scattered union ast

include::sail:decode[from=riscv-code,type=val]
include::sail:execute[from=riscv-code,type=val]
----

Now we provide the clauses for the add-immediate `ast` type, as well
as its execute and decode clauses. We can define the decode function
by directly pattern matching on the bitvector representing the
instruction. Sail supports vector concatenation patterns (`@` is the
vector concatenation operator), and uses the types provided
(e.g. `bits(12)` and `regbits`) to destructure the vector in the
correct way. We use the `EXTS` function that sign-extends its
argument.

[source,sail]
----
union clause ast = ITYPE : (bits(12), regbits, regbits, iop)

include::sail:decode[from=riscv-code,grep="ITYPE"]

include::sail:execute[from=riscv-code,clause="ITYPE(_, _, _, _)"]
----

Now we do the same thing for the load-double instruction:

[source,sail]
----
union clause ast = LOAD : (bits(12), regbits, regbits)

include::sail:decode[from=riscv-code,grep="LOAD"]

include::sail:execute[from=riscv-code,clause="LOAD(_, _, _)"]
----

Finally we define the fallthrough case for the decode function. Note
that the clauses in a scattered function will be matched in the order
they appear in the file.

sail::decode[from=riscv-code,grep="^None"]
