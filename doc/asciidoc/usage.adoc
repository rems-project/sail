In its most basic use-case Sail is a command-line tool, analogous to
a compiler: one gives it a list of input Sail files; it type-checks
them and provides translated output.

To simply typecheck Sail files, one can pass them on the command line
with no other options, for example:
[source,sh]
----
sail prelude.sail riscv_types.sail riscv_mem.sail riscv_sys.sail riscv_vmem.sail riscv.sail
----
The sail files passed on the command line are simply treated as if
they are one large file concatenated together, although the parser
will keep track of locations on a per-file basis for
error-reporting. As can be seen, this specification is split into
several logical components. `prelude.sail` defines the initial
type environment and builtins, `riscv_types.sail` gives type
definitions used in the rest of the specification, `riscv_mem.sail`
and `riscv_vmem.sail` describe the physical and virtual memory
interaction, and then `riscv_sys.sail` and `riscv.sail`
implement most of the specification.

One can use also use `$include` directives in Sail source, for
example:
[source,sail]
----
$include <library.sail>
$include "file.sail"
----

Here, Sail will look for `library.sail` in the `$SAIL_DIR/lib`
directory, where `$SAIL_DIR` is usually the root of the sail
repository (or `opam var sail:share` when Sail is installed using
opam). It will search for `file.sail` relative to the location of the
file containing the `$include`. The space after the `$include` before
the filename is mandatory. Sail also supports `$define`, `$ifdef`, and
`$ifndef` for basic conditional compilation. These are things that are
understood by Sail itself, not a separate preprocessor, and are
handled after the AST is parsed.

For more complex projects, a module hierarchy can be defined. See the
<<Modules>> section for details.

=== Sail options

For backwards compatibility reasons, Sail accepts arguments of the
form `-long_opt`, i.e. leading with a single `-` and words
separated by `_`. Such an option will be treated the same as
`--long-opt`.

For a list of all options, one can call Sail as `sail --help`.

<<<
=== C compilation

To compile Sail into C, the `-c` option is used, like so:
[source,sh]
----
sail -c FILES 1> out.c
----
The translated C is by default printed to stdout, but one can also use
the `-o` option to output to a file, so
[source,sh]
----
sail -c FILES -o out
----
will generate a file called `out.c`. To produce an executable
this needs to be compiled and linked with the C files in the
`$SAIL_DIR/lib` directory:
[source,sh]
----
gcc out.c $SAIL_DIR/lib/*.c -lgmp -lz -I $SAIL_DIR/lib/ -o out
----
The C output requires the https://gmplib.org/[GMP library] for arbitrary precision
arithmetic, as well as https://zlib.net/[zlib] for working with compressed ELF binaries.

There are several Sail options that affect the C output:

* `-O` turns on optimisations. The generated C code will be quite slow
    unless this flag is set.

* `--Oconstant-fold` apply constant folding optimisations.

* `--c-include` Supply additional header files to be included in the
    generated C.

* `--c-no-main` Do not generate a `main()` function.

* `--static` Mark generated C functions as static where possible. This
    is useful for measuring code coverage.

=== SystemVerilog compilation (Experimental)

CAUTION: This feature is new and experimental, so it is not guaranteed
to provide working SystemVerilog. Furthermore, it is intended for
hardware model checking against a hand-written design. Sail is not a
hardware description language!

To compile Sail into SystemVerilog, the `--sv` option is used. The `-o`
option provides a prefix that is used on the various generated files.

There are several options for the SystemVerilog output:

* `--sv-output-dir` Generate all files in the specified directory

* `--sv-include` Add an include directive to the generated SystemVerilog

* `--sv-verilate` Can be used as either `--sv-verilate run` or
  `--sv-verilate compile`. If used Sail will automatically invoke
  https://www.veripool.org/verilator/[verilator] on the generated
  SystemVerilog


* `--sv-lines` Output SystemVerilog `line directives to aid debugging.

* `--sv-int-size` Set the maximum integer size allowed in the specification.

* `--sv-bits-size` Bound the maximum bitvector width on the generated SystemVerilog.

* `--sv-specialize` The `--sv-specialize n` option will perform `n`
  rounds of specialisation on the Sail code before generating
  SystemVerilog. This will make bitvectors more monomorphic, but at
  the cost of code duplication.

The are various other options that control various minutae about the
generated SystemVerilog, see `sail --help` for more details.


<<<
=== Automatic formatting (Experimental)

CAUTION: This feature is new and experimental, so be sure to inspect
changes to source made by the tool and use at your own risk!

Sail supports automatic code formatting similar to tools like `go fmt`
or `rustfmt`. This is built into Sail itself, and can be used via the
`--fmt` flag. To format a file `my_file.sail`, we would use the command:
[source,sh]
----
sail --fmt my_file.sail
----

Note that Sail does not attempt to type-check files when formatting
them, so in this case we do not necessarily have to pass the other
files that `my_file.sail` would otherwise require to
type-check. However, it is perfectly fine to pass multiple files like
so:
[source,sh]
----
sail --fmt file1.sail file2.sail file3.sail
----

The one exception is if a file uses a custom infix operator, then the
file that declares that operator must be passed before any file that
uses it. So if `my_file.sail` uses an operator declared in
`operator.sail` (otherwise it would not be able to parenthesize infix
expressions correctly), we would be required to do:
[source,sh]
----
sail --fmt operator.sail my_file.sail
----
This will format both files. If we want to avoid formatting
`operator.sail`, we could either use `--fmt-skip`, like so:
[source,sh]
----
sail --fmt-skip operator.sail --fmt operator.sail my_file.sail
----
or the `--fmt-only` option, like so:
[source,sh]
----
sail --fmt-only my_file.sail --fmt operator.sail my_file.sail
----
Both of these options can be passed multiple times if required.

Formatting configuration is done using a JSON configuration file:
as:
[source,json]
----
include::../../test/format/default/config.json[]
----
which is passed to sail with the `--config` flag.

The various keys supported under the `"fmt"` key are as follows:

* `indent` The default indentation level

* `preserve_structure` Preserve the structure of the syntax tree as
  much as possible. Note that the use of this operation is not
  recommended as it inhibits many formatting options, such as
  inserting blocks on if statements and loops.

* `line_width` The desired maximum line-width. Note that this is a
  soft limit, and the line-width can go beyond if there are no
  possible line break options (e.g. if you have _extremely_ long
  identifiers).

* `ribbon_width` A soft limit on what proportion (between 0.0 and 1.0)
  of the line should be non-whitespace. A value of 1.0 indicates that the
  entirity of `line_width` can be taken up by non-whitespace.

If this file is not passed on the command line, Sail will check the
`$SAIL_CONFIG` environment variable, and if that is unset it will
search for a file named `sail_config.json` in the current working
directory, then recursively backwards through parent directories.

<<<
=== Interactive mode

Sail has a GHCi-style interactive interpreter. This can be used by
starting Sail with `sail -i`.  Sail will still handle any other
command line arguments as per usual. To use Sail files within the
interpreter they must be passed on the command line as if they were
being compiled normally. One can also pass a list of commands to the
interpreter by using the `--is` flag, as
[source,sh]
----
sail --is <file>
----
where `<file>` contains a list of commands. Once inside the
interactive mode, a list of available commands can be accessed by
typing `:commands`, while `:help <command>` can be used to provide
some documentation for each command.

<<<
=== Other options

Here we summarize most of the other options available for
Sail. Debugging options (usually for debugging Sail itself) are
indicated by starting with the letter `d`.

* `-v` Print the Sail version.

* `-help` Print a list of options.

* `--no-warn` Turn off warnings.

* `--enum-casts` Allow elements of enumerations to be
  automatically cast to numbers.

* `--memo-z3` Memoize calls to the Z3 solver. This can greatly improve
  typechecking times if you are repeatedly typechecking the same
  specification while developing it.

* `--no-lexp-bounds-check` Turn off bounds checking in the left hand
  side of assignments. This option only exists for some Sail translated
  from ASL (as ASL does not do compile-time bounds checking here).

* `--just-check` Force Sail to terminate immediately after
  typechecking.

* `--require-version`. Check that the Sail version is newer than the
  specified version, if not Sail will print an error and exit with a
  non-zero exit code.

<<<
=== Debug options

These options are mostly used for debugging the Sail compiler itself.
They are included as they might be useful for those writing custom Sail
plugins. These options are all prefixed with `d`.

* `--dtc-verbose <verbosity>` Make the typechecker print a
  trace of typing judgements. If the verbosity level is 1, then this
  should only include fairly readable judgements about checking and
  inference rules. If verbosity is 2 then it will include a large
  amount of debugging information. This option can be useful to
  diagnose tricky type-errors, especially if the error message isn't
  very good.

* `--ddump-initial-ast` Write the AST out immediately after parsing
  and desugaring.

* `--ddump-tc-ast` Write the typechecked AST to stdout after
  typechecking

* `--ddump-side-effects` Print inferred information about function
  side effects

* `--ddump-rewrite-ast <prefix>` Write the AST out after each
  re-writing pass. The output from each pass is placed in a file
  starting with `prefix`.

* `--dmagic-hash` Allow the `#` symbol in identifiers. It's
  currently used as a magic symbol to separate generated identifiers
  from those the user can write, so this option allows for the output
  of the various other debugging options to be fed back into Sail. The
  name comes from the GHC option with the same purpose:
