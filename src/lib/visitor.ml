(****************************************************************
 * Visitor support code
 *
 * The code in this file is copied from George Necula's excellent
 * CIL project (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/)
 * with minor change to allow it to be used with an arbitrary AST,
 * taken from ASLi.
 ****************************************************************)

(****************************************************************
 * Visit action
 *
 * Visitor methods can request one of four actions on the AST.
 ****************************************************************)

(** Different visiting actions. 'a will be instantiated with various AST types. *)
type 'a visit_action =
  | SkipChildren  (** Do not visit the children. Return the node as it is. *)
  | DoChildren
      (** Continue with the children of this node. Rebuild the node on
          return if any of the children changes (use == test) *)
  | DoChildrenPost of (unit -> unit)
      (** Continue with the chuldren of the node the same as DoChildren.
          However run the provided function after visiting the children *)
  | ChangeTo of 'a  (** Replace the expression with the given one *)
  | ChangeDoChildrenPost of 'a * ('a -> 'a)
      (** First consider that the entire exp is replaced by the first
     parameter. Then continue with the children. On return rebuild the
     node if any of the children has changed and then apply the
     function on the node *)

(****************************************************************
 * Visitor engine
 *
 * These functions implement the various actions a visitor can
 * request and provide helper functions for writing visitors.
 *
 * Note that the visitor functions implement a space-saving optimisation:
 * if the result would be identical to the input value, they return the
 * input value to avoid allocating another copy of the object.
 * This optimisation is supported by the mapNoCopy, mapNoCopyList
 * and doVisitList functions.
 *
 * This code is changed from the CIL original by replacing the
 * "cilVisitor" type by "'v" so that the code is independent of
 * the particular AST it is used with.
 ****************************************************************)
