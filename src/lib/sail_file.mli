    different paths for the same file so we can set this to
    Sys.realpath, and we will then treat files with the same canonical
    name as the same file.

    We can't just use realpath directly because it would mean
    increasing our minimum OCaml version to 4.13. *)
val set_canonicalize_function : (string -> string) -> unit

(** Open a file and return a 'handle' to it's contents. Note that the
    file is not actually held open -- we read the contents, then close
    the handle storing the file information and contents in memory. As
    such there is no close_file. Repeatedly calling this file on the
    same string (as determined by [set_canonicalize_function]) will
    return the same handle. *)
val open_file : string -> handle

(** Replace the contents of a file. Note that this only changes the
    in-memory contents of the file, and does not flush the changes to
    disk. *)
val write_file : contents:string -> handle -> unit

(** The the LSP takes control of a file by sending us a
    DidOpenTextDocument message, with the contents of the file as seen
    by the editor. *)
val editor_take_file : contents:string -> string -> handle

(** The LSP can stop editing a file using the DidCloseTextDocument
    message, in which case we need to manage the file. *)

type text_edit_size = Single_line of int | Multiple_lines of { pre : int; newlines : int; post : int }

(** Store a pending text edit to a file. This is used by
    [editor_position] and [lexing_position] to synchonize locations
    between the last type-checked version of the file, and any changes
    that have subsequently been made in the editor. Note that it does
    not change the actual contents of the file. *)
val edit_file : handle -> text_edit -> unit

(** Take a Sail AST position, and return the where it will visibly
    appear in the user's editor. Returns None if the position no
    longer exists in the editor buffer, for example, the user may have
    deleted the position. *)
val editor_position : Lexing.position -> editor_position option

(** Take a cursor position in the editor, and map it to a position in
    the Sail AST. Returns None if the cursor position is within a
    pending edit that has not yet been processed by Sail. *)
val lexing_position : handle -> editor_position -> Lexing.position option

(** The contents of a Sail file as a string, without any pending
    edits. *)
val contents : handle -> string

(** This module aims to provide a drop-in replacement for the stdlib
    in_channel functionality used by Sail, essentially providing an
    iterator style interface to the file contents. *)
