(** We can specify a list of identifiers that we want to remove from
   the final AST here. This is useful for removing tracing features in
   optimized builds, e.g. for booting an OS as fast as possible.

   Basically we just do this by mapping

   f(x, y, z) -> ()

   when f is in the list of identifiers to be mapped to unit. The
   advantage of doing it like this is if x, y, and z are
   computationally expensive then we remove them also. String
   concatentation is very expensive at runtime so this is something we
   really want when cutting out tracing features. Obviously it's
   important that they don't have any meaningful side effects, and
   that f does actually have type unit.

(** This rewriting pass looks for function applications (E_app)
   expressions where every argument is a literal. It passes these
   expressions to the OCaml interpreter in interpreter.ml, and
   reconstructs the values returned back into expressions which are
   then re-typechecked and re-inserted back into the AST.

   We don't use the effect system to decide if expressions are safe to
   evaluate, because this ignores I/O, and would force us to ignore
   functions that maybe throw exceptions internally but as called are
   totally safe. Instead any exceptions during evaluation are caught,
   and the original expression is kept. Some causes of this could be:

   - Function tries to read/write register.
   - Calls an unsafe primop.
   - Throws an exception that isn't caught.

          register field as <register>.<field>=<value>. Note that this is not used to set registers normally, but \
          instead fixes their value such that the constant folding rewrite (which is subsequently invoked by this \
          command) will replace register reads with the fixed values. Requires a target (c, lem, etc.), as the set of \
          functions that can be constant folded can differ on a per-target basis."
