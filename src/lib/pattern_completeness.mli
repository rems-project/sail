(** For testing, we don't want our tests to print exact literals in
    warnings, otherwise they would be overly brittle. This is because
    we use an SMT solver to find counterexamples to complex
    constrained patterns, and it's not guaranteed to find the same one
    each run, or between different versions of the solver. *)
