(** In Sail, we need to distinguish between pure and impure
   (side-effecting) functions. This is because there are few places,
   such as top-level let-bindings and loop termination measures where
   side effects must clearly be forbidden. This module implements
   inference for which functions are pure and which are effectful, and
   checking the above purity restrictions. *)

(** A function is side-effectful if it throws an exception, can exit
   abnormally (either via an assertion failing or an explicit exit
   statement), contains a (possibly) incomplete pattern match, or
   touches a register. Finally, it is transitively side-effectful if
   it calls another function doing any of the above. *)

   monad constructors in the concurrency interface, replacing the
   various ad-hoc rmem, wmem, barrier, and so on effects in previous

   library, the equivalent to checking for the wmem effect would be:
