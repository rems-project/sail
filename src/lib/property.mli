(** [find_properties defs] returns a mapping from ids to of 4-tuples of the form
   (prop_type, command, loc, val_spec), which contains the information
   from any pragmas of the form

   $prop_type command
   ...
   val <val_spec>

   where prop_type is either "counterexample" or "property" and the
   location loc is the location that was attached to the pragma
*)
val find_properties : ('a, 'b) ast -> (string * string * l * 'a val_spec) Bindings.t

(** For a property

   $prop_type val f : forall X, C. T -> bool

   find the function body for id:

   function f(args) = exp

   and rewrite the function body to

   function f(args) = if constraint(not(C)) then true else exp

   The reason we do this is that the type information in T constrained
   by C might be lost when translating to Jib, as Jib types are
   simpler and less precise. If we then do random test
   generation/proving we want to ensure that inputs outside the
   constraints of the function are ignored.
