(** Infrastructure for plugins to register Sail targets.

   A {e target} is essentially a custom backend for the Sail compiler,
   along with various hooks and options that toggle various frontend
   behaviours. A target therefore specifies what kind of output Sail
   will produce. For example, we provide default plugins that define
   targets to output Lem, C, OCaml, Coq, and so on. *)

(** {2 Target registration} *)

(** Used for plugins to register custom Sail targets/backends.

   [register_target ~name:"foo" action] will create an option -foo,
   that will run the provided action on the Sail abstract syntax tree
   after performing common frontend processing.

   The various arguments can be used to further control the
   behavior of the target:

   @param ~name The name of the target
   @param ?flag A custom command line flag to invoke the target. By default it will use the name parameter
   @param ?description A custom description for the command line flag
   @param ?options Additional options for the Sail executable
   @param ?pre_parse_hook A function to call right at the start, before parsing
   @param ?pre_initial_check_hook A function to call after parsing, but before de-sugaring
   @param ?pre_rewrites_hook A function to call before doing any rewrites
   @param ?rewrites A sequence of Sail to Sail rewrite passes for the target
   @param ?asserts_termination Whether termination measures are enforced by assertions in the target

   The final unnamed parameter is the main backend function that is called after the frontend
   has finished processing the input.
