(*
This file is used to generate manifest.ml when you use OPAM to install Sail.
If instead you use Dune then manifest.ml will not exist and Dune will use
sail_manifest.ml to generate it.

So in this file we use OPAM to find the share directory. In sail_manifest.ml
we set `dir` to `None` so that Sail will look relative to the `sail` binary.
