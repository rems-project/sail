(** opt_extra_params and opt_extra_arguments allow additional state to

   opt_extra_params := Some "CPUMIPSState *env"
   opt_extra_arguments := Some "env"

   and every generated function will take a pointer to a QEMU MIPS
   processor state, and each function will be passed the env argument
   when it is called. *)
